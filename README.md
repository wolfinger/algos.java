# algos.java

now i'm writing java code to implement the data structures and algorithms covered in [a common-sense guide to data structures and algorithms, second edition](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second-ebook-dp-B08KYMK4NR/dp/B08KYMK4NR) by jay wengrow<br>

note the focus here is on the algos, not well-formed oop so i made a lot of things public that should not be. focus was on speed not maintainability.
